### Development Guardrails

1. Branch: `<type>/<short-desc>`
2. PR body: `Fixes #<num>`
3. **Post-implementation checklist (MANDATORY — in order, do not skip):**
   a. Commit changes with `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   b. Parallel quality gates: run Codex review (background) + `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` (foreground) concurrently
   c. Both must pass on the same commit — if fixing one invalidates the other, iterate
   d. Create PR (or push to existing) with `Fixes #<num>`
   e. Run `/pm-review` self-check (ANALYSIS_ONLY action) — address findings, return to (b) if code changed
   f. Move to Review: `pm move <num> Review`
4. After merge: `pm move <num> Done`
```

## Compact Format (CLOSED mode)

```markdown
## Issue #<num>: <title>

**Completed** via PR #<pr_num> on <date>

Files changed: <count>
Acceptance criteria: <X/Y met>
```
