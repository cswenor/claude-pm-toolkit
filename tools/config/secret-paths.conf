# secret-paths.conf - Custom path patterns for secret detection
#
# Add one glob or substring pattern per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines are ignored.
#
# These patterns are checked by claude-secret-check-path.sh
# (PreToolUse hook for Read/Edit tools) in addition to the
# built-in patterns (env files, SSH keys, cloud credentials, etc.).
#
# Examples:
# .secrets/
# credentials.yaml
# **/vault-config*
# deploy-keys/
